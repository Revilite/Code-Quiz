## Description
This project is supposed to be a coding quiz game, you hit the start button on the start screen which then transfers to another screen that has a question and 4 answers and a timer that starts to count down every second. When the timer hits 0 it then shows the highscore screen which you can add your initials and then it saves to the local storage.
